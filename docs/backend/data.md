# Local Development Data

The `backend/data` directory contains seed data files used by the backend when running in **local development** (`NODE_ENV=development`).

By default, the backend reads from and writes to this directory instead of
connecting to AWS S3. This keeps all local work fully isolated from the deployed
Dev environment on AWS.

To connect to real S3 while running locally (e.g. to test against live data
without deploying), set `USE_LOCAL_S3=false` in your `.env` file. AWS
credentials must be configured for this to work. See `.env.example` for
details.

## Populating with real data

If you need realistic data locally, you can download files from the Dev S3
buckets and place them into `backend/data`.

1. Log in with AWS SSO:

```bash
aws sso login
```

1. Copy the files into the correct folders:

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://<S3 Object Path> backend/data/<path>
```

Full commands on doing this are available within KEH's Confluence. There is a `Digital Landscape Local Data` playbook that contains commands to copy and paste into your terminal to download the data. _**(Internal only)**_

## Notes

- Keep downloaded data local and avoid committing real environment data.
